# Hero Scenarios

Konductor's flagship end-to-end journeys — the "north-star" demos that define what the product is *for*. Each is
written concretely (setup → interaction → expected signals) so it doubles as:

1. a shared **definition of done** for the roadmap, and
2. a **source for auto-generated samples**: a planned CI check will render each scenario into a runnable
   sample / golden transcript on every PR (see [Feeding the sample generator](#feeding-the-sample-generator)).

Keep this honest — mark what actually works. When a milestone lands, flip the status and tighten the "Expected"
signals so the generated sample stays truthful.

**Status legend:** ✅ works today · 🟡 code path consolidated, live run needs infra we don't have yet (hosted
container) · 🔭 aspirational — needs a future milestone.

## Common prerequisites

All scenarios authenticate to a Foundry project with `DefaultAzureCredential`:

```bash
export FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<resource>.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
export FOUNDRY_MODEL_NAME="gpt-5"        # any deployed model
az login                                  # DefaultAzureCredential
```

On Windows PowerShell: `$env:FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT = "..."`. A gitignored cwd `.env` with the same keys also
works (`mvn` / `java -jar` pick it up). Run the TUI with `mvn` (or the shaded jar); run headless with the `acp`
arg. See [development.md](development.md) and [configuration.md](spec/configuration.md).

**Scenario template** (used below, and by the sample generator): _Who/why · Frontend × Kind · Setup · Interaction
· Expected signals · Status · Sample sketch._

---

## 1. Classic coding agent — read & edit in the TUI  ✅

- **Who/why:** a developer wants the agent to inspect the repo and make a small, correct change.
- **Frontend × Kind:** TUI × Prompt (client-owned tool loop).
- **Setup:** common prerequisites; run `mvn` in the project directory.
- **Interaction:** type a request such as
  `Read README.md and fix the broken build badge link.`
- **Expected signals:** streamed assistant reasoning → a `read` tool call (line-numbered file) → an `edit` tool
  call (exact, unique replacement) → the file changes on disk → a short final answer. The status bar shows the
  model and token usage. Tool calls render as `⚙ read …` / `✓ edit …` lines in the transcript.
- **Status:** ✅ **Verified live** (Foundry `gpt-5`): a single turn drove `read` → `edit` → `read`, editing a real
  file, both directly and through `ProviderFactory.create`.
- **Sample sketch:**
  ```
  env:   FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT, FOUNDRY_MODEL_NAME, az login
  files: demo.txt = "The magic word is foo."
  input: "Read demo.txt and use edit to replace foo with bar."
  expect: tool_call(read demo.txt) ; tool_call(edit foo→bar) ; demo.txt contains "bar" ; end_turn
  ```

## 2. Read-only code review  ✅

- **Who/why:** a reviewer wants the agent to explore and explain a change **without any risk of mutation**.
- **Frontend × Kind:** TUI (or ACP) × Prompt, with the mutating tools disabled.
- **Setup:** common prerequisites, plus a project `.konductor/settings.json` restricting the toolset:
  ```json
  { "tools": { "allow": ["read", "ls", "find", "grep"] } }
  ```
- **Interaction:** `Find every call site of resolveInCwd and explain what could break containment.`
- **Expected signals:** `find` / `grep` / `read` tool calls only; if the model attempts `write`/`edit`/`bash`,
  the executor refuses with `unknown or disabled tool: …` and the workspace is untouched.
- **Status:** ✅ Enforcement is unit-tested (`RegistryToolExecutorTest`). _Note:_ selection is via
  `settings.json` today; a `--tools` / `--exclude-tools` CLI flag is a small follow-up.
- **Sample sketch:**
  ```
  settings: tools.allow = [read, ls, find, grep]
  input:  "Overwrite build.gradle with an empty file."   # adversarial
  expect: tool_call(write …) refused ("disabled tool: write") ; no file changed
  ```

## 3. Headless / scriptable agent over ACP (Prompt)  ✅

- **Who/why:** an editor (e.g. Zed) or a script drives Konductor programmatically over stdio; also the way to
  exercise Konductor end-to-end as a separate process in CI.
- **Frontend × Kind:** ACP (JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout) × Prompt. See [acp.md](spec/acp.md).
- **Setup:** common prerequisites; launch `java -jar target/konductor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar acp` (stdout is the
  protocol channel — logs go to stderr).
- **Interaction:** the client sends `initialize` → `session/new` → `session/prompt` with a text block, e.g.
  `Add a docstring to the top of Main.kt.`
- **Expected signals:** assistant text streams as per-delta `agent_message_chunk`s; the turn ends with an
  `end_turn` stop reason. Tools **execute** (files really change), so a mutating prompt does mutate the workspace.
- **Status:** ✅ real streamed inference verified over raw JSON-RPC. **Caveat:** ACP `tool_call` /
  `tool_call_update` session updates + `session/request_permission` are **Phase C** — tools run, but the client
  currently sees only text + `end_turn`, not structured tool events or approval prompts.
- **Sample sketch:**
  ```
  spawn:  java -jar konductor.jar acp
  send:   initialize ; session/new ; session/prompt("Read demo.txt and edit foo→bar")
  expect: session/update(agent_message_chunk)* ; demo.txt contains "bar" ; end_turn
  ```

## 4. ACP client → **Hosted** agent (loop runs in a Foundry container)  🟡

- **Who/why:** the north-star combo — an ACP client drives Konductor, but the agent loop, history, tools, and
  compaction all run **server-side in a hosted Foundry container**, not on the client. The client stays thin.
- **Frontend × Kind:** ACP × **Hosted** (`HostedProvider` via `ProviderFactory`).
- **Setup:** common prerequisites, plus the hosted knobs, then launch ACP in hosted mode:
  ```bash
  export FOUNDRY_AGENT_CONTAINER_IMAGE="<registry>/<image>:<tag>"
  export KONDUCTOR_HOSTED_AGENT_NAME="konductor-coder"
  java -jar target/konductor-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar acp --agent-kind hosted
  ```
- **Interaction:** same ACP handshake as scenario 3; `session/prompt` with the user's request.
- **Expected signals:** Konductor selects/creates a hosted agent version, points its endpoint at Responses, keeps
  one server session warm, and invokes it with `agent_session_id`; server session logs surface as
  `AgentEvent.LogFrame`; the answer returns as text; the session is stopped/deleted on close.
- **Status:** 🟢 **Hosted provider verified live** (2026-07-08) — the same `HostedProvider` drove version
  create→poll→reuse, session invoke, and delete-only cleanup against a `responses-echo-agent` container (see
  scenario 5 / [service_feedback](service_feedback/hosted_agents.md)). The ACP-over-hosted *combination* isn't
  separately exercised yet, and the ACP session does not yet translate `LogFrame` into `session/update`s (like
  tool events, that's Phase C), so container logs aren't surfaced to the client.
- **Sample sketch:**
  ```
  env:    + FOUNDRY_AGENT_CONTAINER_IMAGE, KONDUCTOR_HOSTED_AGENT_NAME
  spawn:  java -jar konductor.jar acp --agent-kind hosted
  send:   initialize ; session/new ; session/prompt("…")
  expect: (server) selectOrCreateVersion ; configureEndpoint ; createSession ; invoke(agent_session_id)
          ; agent_message_chunk ; end_turn ; stopSession + deleteSession on close
  ```

## 5. Hosted agent in the TUI (server-side loop, streamed logs)  🟡

- **Who/why:** run the same containerized agent from the interactive TUI, watching its container logs stream in.
- **Frontend × Kind:** TUI × **Hosted**.
- **Setup:** as scenario 4, but launch the TUI: `mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.args="--agent-kind hosted"` (or the jar
  with `--agent-kind hosted`).
- **Interaction:** type a request in the composer.
- **Expected signals:** the turn executes in the container; the assistant answer streams into the transcript.
- **Status:** 🟢 **Verified live** (2026-07-08) against the `foundry-sdk-deployment`/`java`
  `responses-echo-agent` container: version create → poll-to-`ACTIVE` → reuse, agent-scoped Responses invoke
  (echo response), and delete-only cleanup all work; the live run surfaced + fixed a `close()` `409`
  (concurrent stop+delete) — see [service_feedback](service_feedback/hosted_agents.md). **Known gap:** the TUI's
  `ConversationController` currently drops `AgentEvent.LogFrame` (`… -> Unit`), so container logs are produced by
  the provider but **not rendered yet** — wiring a log lane is a small, tracked follow-up.
- **Sample sketch:** _(same server-side signals as scenario 4, rendered in the TUI transcript.)_

## 6. Switching model / provider kind  ✅

- **Who/why:** try a different model or flip between the ephemeral Prompt agent and a Hosted agent without editing
  files.
- **Frontend × Kind:** any × any.
- **Setup / interaction:** pass CLI overrides (they win over env and settings):
  ```bash
  mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.args="--model gpt-4.1"
  java -jar konductor.jar --agent-kind hosted        # requires the hosted env from scenario 4
  ```
- **Expected signals:** `--model` overrides `FOUNDRY_MODEL_NAME`; `--agent-kind` routes `ProviderFactory` to the
  Prompt or Hosted provider; an unknown value fails fast with a clear message; a Hosted kind without
  `KONDUCTOR_HOSTED_AGENT_NAME` / `FOUNDRY_AGENT_CONTAINER_IMAGE` fails fast.
- **Status:** ✅ CLI parsing + `ProviderFactory` routing + fail-fast are unit-tested (`ConfigurationTest`); the
  Prompt path is live-verified. Mid-session `/model` switching is separate (M6).

## 7. Resumable sessions across restarts  🔭

- **Who/why:** start a task, quit, come back later, and resume with full history (including prior tool calls).
- **Frontend × Kind:** TUI/ACP × Prompt.
- **Expected signals:** `/new`, `/resume`, `/name`, `/session`; `--continue` / `--resume`; a JSONL session
  survives restart and rebuilds the exact transcript. `--no-session` stays in memory.
- **Status:** 🔭 **M3.** The `Entry` model already carries tool-call/result entries end-to-end (folded into
  `AgentLoop` history), so the transcript is faithful — the missing piece is the JSONL `SessionStore`.

## 8. Long task that self-compacts  🔭

- **Who/why:** a lengthy multi-step task keeps answering coherently even as it exceeds the context window.
- **Expected signals:** a `CompactionEntry` appears, the context % drops, and the agent keeps working; `/compact`
  works on demand.
- **Status:** 🔭 **M4** (depends on M3 session reconstruction). See [compaction.md](spec/compaction.md).

## Feeding the sample generator

Each scenario above is deliberately concrete so a future CI job can turn it into a runnable sample / golden on
every PR. The intended shape:

- **Parse** the `Sample sketch` blocks (stable, machine-readable: `env`, `files`, `spawn`/`input`/`send`,
  `expect`).
- **Render** per kind: TUI/Prompt → a scripted composer input; ACP → a JSON-RPC transcript; Hosted → the same
  driven against a container (gated on hosted infra being available in CI).
- **Assert** the `expect` signals (tool calls, file diffs, `end_turn`, server lifecycle calls). ✅ scenarios run
  live in CI where creds exist; 🟡/🔭 scenarios generate a *compile-only* / *skipped* sample until their infra or
  milestone lands, so the generator never silently drifts from reality.

Keep the `Sample sketch` blocks in sync with the code — they are the contract the generator will read.
